# Recipe App with Firebase and Webpack

A simple recipe app for keeping track of your mother's favourite dishes. You can also include a list of the food's ingredients, a link to a blog or vlog that shows how it's created, and other information.

## Motivation

I started this endeavour because I adore my mother's cooking and believe she is the best cook on the planet. So I started this PROJECT to share her recipes with the world.
